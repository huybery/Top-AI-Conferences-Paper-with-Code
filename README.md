# Top-AI-Conferences-Paper-with-Code

## Motivation

This repository is a collection of AI top conferences papers (e.g. ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, COLING, AAAI, IJCAI, ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML) with **open resource code**.

As we all know, it is very difficult for a paper to describe every implement detail within a limited number of pages. A work with open resource code offers us more information and makes it easier for us to reproduce and follow. We organized these papers for easy reference.

## Updates
- 2021.11.28 add AAAI 2019, AAAI 2020, AAAI2021

## Call for Contributions

Contributions are strongly welcomed, you are encouraged to submit issues and Pull Requests.
